# tabetai ver 0 (new version coming soon)

Tabetai (食べたい) is a user-friendly recipe app that you can access anywhere with an internet connection—whether it's on your computer, iPad, Xbox (though we’re not sure why you’d want to cook with an Xbox), or any other device.

Cooking should be simple and enjoyable, free from the clutter of pop-ups and intrusive ads that dominate so many recipe websites today. With Tabetai, you can effortlessly create, view, edit, update, and share your recipes with others.
